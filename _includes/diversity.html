    We’re excited to announce that we’ll soon be launching a Global Community Support Programme for Code BEAM STO 2025! This programme will help broaden access to the conference, offering support to individuals, startups, and those transitioning to Erlang and Elixir. It will provide opportunities to gain insights, connect with the community, and explore the latest in BEAM technologies. The programme is designed to empower those who may not otherwise be able to attend, giving access to the latest insights in the Erlang ecosystem.</a>
