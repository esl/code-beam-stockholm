Dániel fell in love with Erlang a decade ago, working for Ericsson in Budapest. After his project got outsourced to India he tried himself as a consultant. Unfortunately, it turned out that kicking off many projects but hardly ever seeing them finish is not everyone's dream job, and working for short periods of time in far away places is not everyone's wife's dream scenario either. So he moved to Stockholm to join Klarna, and ever since he's happily tweaking a big and old system for scalability and stability.
