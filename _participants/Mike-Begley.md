With more than 25 years of leadership positions, product management and working with product development in the telecommunications industry, I have accumulated extensive experience in managing business and product strategies, cradle-to-grave product lifecycles, market demand analysis, developing business cases, requirement definition, system design, sponsorship of large R&D projects, product introduction, supply chain definition, go-to-market and customer relationship management. My experience covers both software and hardware development.

Technology continues to transform the world we live in and as responsible for our RAN Compute portfolio, I have the interesting and challenging task to define our product offering by exploring cutting edge technology and understanding how it can address our customers challenges.

I am working at the intersection of technology and business, together with my team we create technology solutions that brings positive change to customers and the wider world around us.
